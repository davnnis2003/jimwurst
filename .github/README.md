# .github

This directory contains GitHub-specific configurations, including:

- **workflows/**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline definitions.
- **issue_templates/**: Templates for reporting bugs or requesting features.

All CI/CD processes here should support the "100% local execution" tenet by focusing on validation, linting, and local-compatible testing.
